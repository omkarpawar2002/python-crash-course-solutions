## 🧠 Chapter 2 — Variables and Simple Data Types

This chapter introduced me to the fundamentals of **storing and working with data** in Python.

### Key Concepts
- **Variables:** Storing information to use later in the program  
- **Strings:** Handling text, changing case, and concatenating messages  
- **Numbers:** Performing arithmetic and mixing with strings using `str()`  
- **Comments:** Writing helpful notes in code for clarity  
- **Zen of Python:** The guiding principles of clean, readable Python code  

### Example
```python
name = "eric"
message = f"Hello {name.title()}, would you like to learn some Python today?"
print(message)
```
